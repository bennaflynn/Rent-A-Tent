                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Ever wish you could go camping with your friends but realized that you didn't have a big enough tent,
                    and knew that it didn't make it economic sense to buy one? Well we did, and in our cramped Vancouver
                    apartments, we got together to see what we could do about it. Rent-A-Tent is our solution. <br><br>

                    We're four Vancouver guys, Lin, Clayton, Ben, and Daniel, who love to camp and want to help
                    Vancouver do the same. We created Rent-A-Tent as a co-op model to give us all the chance to work
                    together. We have various shipping containers placed in public areas around the Metro Vancouver
                    Area, which are accessible to anyone with a RAT account. No need to store bulky a bulky tent in your
                    home when you're not using it. And no more worries when you need a different size.<br><br>
